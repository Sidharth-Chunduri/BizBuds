Build a responsive web app called **BizBudz** – a student-focused business learning hub.

Overall requirements
- Make the design **clean, modern, and simple** – think cards, plenty of white space, rounded corners, and a friendly student feel.
- Prioritize **readability**: use a clear sans-serif font, a light background, and 2–3 main colors (for example: a white background, a soft blue primary, and an accent color like orange/green for buttons and highlights).
- Use **consistent navigation** across all pages with a top navbar: logo on the left (“BizBudz”), main links on the right: *Home, Dashboard, Schedule, Resources, Explore, Join Now*.
- The app should be **mobile-first and responsive** for desktop, tablet, and phone.
- Implement using a modern stack such as **React + a simple CSS framework** (like Tailwind or minimal custom CSS). Focus on structure and dummy data; no real backend is necessary, but the UI should be wired up as if real data exists.

Pages to implement (6 total)
1. Home
2. Dashboard
3. Signup / Join Now
4. Schedule
5. Resources
6. Explore

Use dummy JSON/state for data such as sessions, courses, notes, quizzes, etc. Buttons and actions can log to console or open modals; they don’t need to be fully functional backends.

### 1. Home Page

Goal: Introduce BizBudz, highlight student success, and guide users to other parts of the site.

Layout:
- **Hero section** at the top:
  - Left: a short tagline like “BizBudz – Learn Business Together” with a one-sentence description.
  - Right: a CTA button **“Join Now”** and a secondary button **“Browse Resources”**.
- **Success Story section**:
  - A card featuring a **successful student story**: student name, short paragraph of their journey, and what they built/achieved.
  - Include a small “Read more stories” link (can lead to Resources or just scroll).
- **Business of the Month section**:
  - A highlighted card titled **“Business of the Month”**:
    - Business name, 1–2 sentence description, and maybe tags (e.g., #ecommerce, #socialimpact).
- **Quick Navigation tiles** (large buttons/cards) linking to:
  - Dashboard (if logged in / mock state), otherwise join page.
  - Schedule (upcoming sessions).
  - Resources.
  - Explore.
- A simple **footer** with minimal links: About, Contact, Terms (non-functional).

Design:
- Use cards with subtle shadows, rounded corners.
- Keep copy short and student-friendly.
- On mobile, stack hero text above buttons.

- Each stat in a small card with icon + label + value.

Learning paths section:

  - Example paths: *Business Fundamentals*, *Marketing & Sales Mastery*, etc.
  - Each path card shows:
    - Title
    - Progress bar (e.g., 60% complete)
    - “Continue” button that would conceptually take the user to the relevant course in Resources.

    - *Quiz Master* – for multiple quizzes completed.
    - *Consistent Learner* – for maintaining a streak.
    - *First Session* – for attending first live session.
  - Display as small badge cards with icon, title, and short description.

  - “Sign Up” button for each opportunity.

**Sign-up panel**

**Quizzes**
- Each course can have associated **quizzes**:

Design:

### 6. Explore Page

Goal: Social discovery of students, notes, and shared resources.

Features:

**Explore Student Profiles / Notes**
- Show a feed/grid of **posts** that represent notes or short lessons created by students.
- Each post card includes:
  - Student name and avatar/initials.
  - Title of the note/lesson.
  - Short preview text.
  - Hashtags (e.g., #marketing, #finance, #startups).
  - Like button with like count.
  - Comment button with comment count.

**Popular & Most Helpful Notes**
- A section or filter at top:
  - Tabs or dropdown: “Most Recent”, “Most Helpful”, “Popular”.
  - “Most Helpful” should sort posts by like count (using dummy data).

**Interactions**
- Each post card must have:
  - **Like button** (toggle state visually, update count in the UI).
  - **Comment button** that opens a comments area or modal with dummy comments.
- Include a small “Give Feedback” text area or modal showing how a student might leave feedback.

**Upload Notes & Videos**
- A simple **“Share Your Notes”** card or button:
  - On click, open a modal or inline form with:
    - Title
    - Text area for notes
    - Optional link (e.g., to a video)
    - Hashtag input (comma separated).
  - Submitting adds a new post to the feed in the UI state (front-end only).

**Featuring Top Contributors**
- Highlight **top students**:
  - A sidebar or section with 2–3 top contributors:
    - Name
    - Badge indicator (e.g., “Top Contributor”, “Most Helpful Notes”).
- Highly liked posts should display a **badge/award** icon on the post card (e.g., “Featured” or “Community Favorite”).

Design:
- Layout similar to a simple social feed.
- On desktop, main feed center, with a right sidebar for “Top Contributors” and maybe a “Hashtag Cloud” (list of hashtags with counts).
- On mobile, stack feed first, then top contributors below.

---

### Additional UX/Design Notes

- Make the navigation bar persistent and highlight the current page.
- Use consistent button styles across the whole site (primary, secondary).
- Show simple breadcrumb-like titles at the top of each page (e.g., “Dashboard”, “Schedule”).
- Even though there’s no real backend, structure the code so that adding APIs later would be straightforward (e.g., components receive data via props or a single mocked data source).

In summary: implement all 6 pages (Home, Dashboard, Signup/Join, Schedule, Resources, Explore) with the functions and sections described above, using clean, student-friendly UI and responsive layout. Use mock data for sessions, courses, notes, and interactions, but wire up all buttons, likes, filters, and forms at the front-end level so the app feels interactive.
